# Digital Twin for Research Wide Area Networks

This is a digital twin framework that uses parallel discrete event simulation (PDES) and machine learning (ML) to simulate research wide area networks (R-WANs).

Goals for this project:
1. Faster network simulation, by speeding up PDES with ML.
2. Composable models to make it easy to add new ML models and use them in your network simulation.
3. User-friendly way to specify network configurations, without requiring PDES experience or other implementation details of the simulator.
4. Dashboard of network performance visualizations for end-users, as well as visualizations relating to simulation performance for use by simulation developers.
